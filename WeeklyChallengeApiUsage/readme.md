# Weekly Challenge - API Usage Challenge

## Goal
Create a console app that will look up people in the SWAPI(www.swapi.co) based on their ID number.  Handle missing IDs/errors
and load all the data for successful entries.

## Bonus
Cache successful requests in memory.  If you call the same call again, have it pull from the cache instead of from the API.  Also,
rename the properties to C#-style names without breaking the lookup.
